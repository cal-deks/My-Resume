    <h2>Oberjective</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! I'm Calvin üôå, a high school senior from Ghana, passionate about the fascinating world of computer science üñ•Ô∏è. My journey in tech began at The Presbyterian Boys‚Äô Secondary School, Legon, where my curiosity and drive led me to delve deep into programming and web development. This fall, I am excited to start a new chapter at Kenyon College üéì, aiming to major in neuroscience with a minor in computer science.

I thrive on the challenge of building and shipping products rapidly ‚è©, a skill I honed through various coding projects and competitions. My projects range from creating engaging websites to developing a Buzzfeed-style personality quiz and an activist toolkit site üåç. These experiences have not only refined my technical skills but have also taught me the importance of user-centric design and agile product development.

Outside the world of code, I have a profound love for tennis üéæ, music üé∂, and community service ‚ù§Ô∏è. I've combined these interests in unique ways, such as co-founding 'Sounds of Hope', where we performed in hospitals across Central Accra to raise awareness and funds for pediatric cancer and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease üè•. Whether it's through my saxophone melodies with the Odade3 Jazz Ensemble or coding new software, I am driven by a desire to make a positive impact in my community and beyond.
